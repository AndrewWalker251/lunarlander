**Reinforcement Learning with the Lunar Lander**

### Intro

OpenAI Gym provides a number of environments for experimenting and testing reinforcement learning algorithms. 

Here I wanted to explore implementing a Double Deep Q Learning Network (DDQN) and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) on the continuous and discrete lunar lander environments.

The environments can be found: https://gym.openai.com/envs/#box2d

The environments can be installed via pip:

```pip install gym```


### Set up

Both the DDQN and DDPG are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks to allow for easy exploration and experiementation.

### References

The DDQN is based on the following pytorch implementation : https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html


### Results
